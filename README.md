# Employee Management System
 
## Description

This project has been created to assist with tracking employees, roles and departments within a business and has been completed as a part of the Adelaide University Web Development bootcamp. The motivation for this project has been to create a user interface within the command line which allows the user to perform various tasks such as viewing, adding, deleting and updating key business departments, roles and employees. This has been completed with the help of mySQL and express.js. 

Completing this project was a useful lesson in maintaining a SQL database by dynamically making queries, inserting, deleting and updating data.
